# Linear Regression
With Linear Regression, we aim to fit a line (or hyperplane) to a set of input/output data points.Regression can be used in machine learning to drive home a particular point about the data under study, visually study a correlation, learn about a model to make percise predictions, and more. Least squares and Least Absolute Deviations are among these techniques.
